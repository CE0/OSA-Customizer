# OSA-SE-Customizer-Equip

## Customizer
Customizer comes with OSA and handles randomization for default NPCs that have no persona/profile data. 
These should be packed when finished into OSA-SE but i pulled them out on git so they are easier / clearer to work on. 

# Equip

Since equipment relates to a single users install this is not able to be filled out except to provide a base template. Forks could be created based on popular equipment setups.
# Style of the equipment

The names that can be achieved in this xml should be lore-friendly and serious as if part of Skyrim itself. Forks can be used for crazier variations.
